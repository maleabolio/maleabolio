# **Hi, my name is Alejandra!**

### I currently work as a Content Analyst for General Motors Canad√° through a marketing agency.

I am a creative, organized, and responsible professional. My focus is on continuously learning and acquiring the necessary skills to create innovative and functional solutions that provide exceptional user experiences. With a background in interface design and project management, I take pride in collaborating within multidisciplinary teams, working efficiently, and achieving established goals. I am dedicated to expanding my knowledge and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in the rapidly evolving web development industry. My passion for technology and web development has led me on the path to actively pursue becoming a JavaScript Full-Stack Developer.

## I'll be sharing some of my practice projects here: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Just sting with React and Node.js!

Do you any proposals or suggestions?
